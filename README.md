## Gameplay loop

Roguelite

Character's base revolves largely around incremental/idle mechanics. Over time a character will earn things like tiles, energy, and health. 

The goal is to build up a 'run' while idling. Players would be rewarded for playing well by making the most of the resources they take on their runs.

A character must 'unlock' tiles. Each time a tile is unlocked various mechanics determine what kind of tile is generated.

### Base

Ideally the character would move around the base to interact with various buildings/machines to enhance and upgrade idle mechanics.

Certain upgrades would be centered around taking gear on a run and setting up a machine or some other mechanic on a specific tile/floor.

### Energy
### Floors

Rarer resources the lower you go.
#### Shovels
